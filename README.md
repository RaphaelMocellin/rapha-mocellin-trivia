# Trivia

Trivia is a type of game in which players are asked questions about different topics and they have to get as many correct answers as possible.
This project's main goal for me was to pratice not only hard skills such React, Context and RTL, but also soft skills such as communication, and team work.
I've managed to build this game fecthing data from a questions API and elaborate a score and leaderboard system using a global state manager such as Context API.
